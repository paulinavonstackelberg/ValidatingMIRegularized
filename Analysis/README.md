| File name            | Description of file                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| `BiasMSE_script.Rmd`   | R Markdown file that can be used to generate the bias, MSE, and mean tables. *Note*: this is an example file in which only parts of the raw results (as shown in the main body of text) are called for the sake of clarity. You can adapt this script to your liking to analyze other raw data. |
| `Plots_manuscript.Rmd` | R Markdown file that can be used to generate the plots. *Note*: this is an example file in which only parts of the raw results (including those in the main body of text) are called for the sake of clarity. You can adapt this script to your liking to generate plots for other conditions.         |
| `potential_error_calculations.Rmd` | R Markdown file that can be used to calculate potential problem proportions, as described in the manuscript in Appendix E. *Note*: this is an example file; other output files can be analyzed, too. |
| `excluded_total`       | R file containing information on the excluded results, as presented in the manuscript Appendix E.
