## Abbreviations

The following abbreviations referring to different estimands are used in the titles:

* AUCBrier: Plots for AUC, Brier scores, sensitivity, specificity
* Cal: Calibration measures (slope and intercept)
* R2: Cox-Snell R2 values
* select: sensitivity and specificity of selection (when LASSO is used)

## Folder structure

The folder titles should be read as follows (illustrated with an example):

The file names should be read as follows (illustrated with an example):

`AUCBrier_0_MAR20_n200`: The plot describing the AUC, Brier score, sensitivity, specificity. Illustrated with a correlation of 0, in the MAR scenario with 20 covariates and n = 200.
